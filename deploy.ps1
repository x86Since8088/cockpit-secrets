.SYNOPSIS
    The Windows half of the deployment contract: copy the declared payload,
    seed .env missing-only, register services and scheduled tasks.

.DESCRIPTION
    READ THIS FIRST. docs/DEPLOY-CONTRACT.md section 1.2 puts Windows OUT OF
    SCOPE for the six Cockpit plugins, and cockpit-secrets is one of them:
    Cockpit is a Linux service, so there is no /usr/share/cockpit on this
    platform and no page for a browser to load. This script therefore REFUSES
    the Cockpit half by name rather than pretending to do it.

    It exists for two real reasons:

      1. It is the reference implementation of sections 1.2 and 6.5 that the
         deliverables which DO ship on Windows copy from - cockpit-wireguard's
         windows-client, edy-proxy-go's Windows agents. Those projects clone
         this file and fill in SERVICES and TASKS.
      2. It stages a payload and its configuration on a Windows host, which is
         how a Windows build agent or an offline transfer step packages one.

    WHY THERE IS NO SYMLINK MODEL HERE (JC-2). mklink needs elevation or
    Developer Mode, junctions behave differently under every backup and AV
    product on the estate, and SeCreateSymbolicLink is an audited privilege. So
    deploy.ps1 COPIES into payload\, and the Windows equivalent of "in-place
    install" is simply that install.ps1 is RUN FROM payload\ and registers
    services pointing there. The cost - no live-edit dev install on Windows -
    is accepted; the dev loop is "build, deploy to C:\dev\<Project>, restart".

    THE SPLIT, and it is the same one as on Linux:
      C:\Program Files\<Project>\payload\   the payload, replaced wholesale
      C:\ProgramData\<Project>\.env         operator config, seeded missing-only
      C:\ProgramData\<Project>\state\       state that survives an upgrade
      C:\ProgramData\<Project>\logs\
    Program Files is UAC-protected and Administrators-writable only, which is
    the correct home for code a service executes. A service running as
    LocalSystem or a virtual account can be granted write on ProgramData
    WITHOUT being granted write over its own binaries. A SERVICE THAT CAN
    REWRITE ITS OWN EXECUTABLE IS A PERSISTENCE MECHANISM, NOT A SERVICE.

.PARAMETER InstallTo
    Override the install root. Must be absolute.

.PARAMETER Uninstall
    Stop and remove the services and scheduled tasks. Keeps ProgramData.

.PARAMETER Remove
    Uninstall, then delete payload\. Still keeps ProgramData, and says so.
